**This project was part of my Test in Nethone**

## Subject: Recruitment Task for Junior Customer Engineer - Database design and SQL query

The project is a test for Nethone, in which it was requested to do two things: Design a database (with some rules and limits, which you can see in the document "Junior CE recruitment tasks.pdf") and write some SQL query (based again in the document "Junior CE recruitment tasks.pdf") 

This folder contains the following: 

1) **Junior CE recruitment tasks.pdf** : document of the test
2) **Nethone Test Diagram.pdf** : Diagram made for the first task (database design) in pdf format
3) **Nethone Teste 01.mwb** : Diagram made for the first task (database design) in mwb format (Mysql workbench model)
4) **SQL query Nethone Test.sql** : Query made for second task (SQL) in SQL format (Mysql format used, but since I didn't use any more complex mysql query, it can be use in any SQL-RDBMS system)
5) **SQL query Nethone test.txt** : Same with SQL query Nethone test.sql but in .txt file

## Prerequites / instructions
1) for first task, if want to view in mwb format, install mysql workbench (last version) and open in top left "file" and then "open model"
2) for second task, if want to view directly in mysql, install workbench (last version) and open in top left "file" and then "open SQL script"
